# Elevens 8

Follow the instructions provided for Activity 8 in the student lab guide. This is more of an exploratory lab, so you will not need to copy any of your previous code into the repo. Answer the questions from the Student Guide in this document and ensure that you save and push the repo. You have one week to complete this lab.

1. Discuss the similarities and differences between *Elevens*, *Thirteens*, and *Tens*.

    * Answer- They all have cards and a deck, they all have a board that can change size with suits ranks and pointValues. They all have the a way to deal out cards and keep track of deck size and each card. They all can check if you have won.

2. As discussed previously, all of the instance variables are declared in the `Board` class. But it is the `ElevensBoard` class that “knows” the board size, and the ranks, suits, and point values of the cards in the deck. How do the `Board` instance variables get initialized with the `ElevensBoard` values? What is the exact mechanism?

    * Answer- They "super." for all the instance variables

3. Now examine the files `Board.java` and `ElevensBoard.java`, found in this repository. Identify the `abstract` methods in `Board.java`. See how these methods are implemented in `ElevensBoard`. Do they cover all the differences between *Elevens*, *Thirteens*, and *Tens* as discussed in question 1? Why or why not?

    * Answer- anotherPlayIsPossible and isLegal. The override methods in elevens only will apply to elevens because they are both only available in elevens and was made to apply to elevens alone.
